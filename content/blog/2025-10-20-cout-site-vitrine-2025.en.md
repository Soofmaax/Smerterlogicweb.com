# How much does a showcase website cost in France in 2025? (Real prices)

<p>You asked three providers for a quote. A freelancer: €800. Another one: €2,500. A Paris agency: €8,000. Same brief, same number of pages, same sector.</p>
<p>First reaction: “Is this a scam?”</p>
<p>I’ve built sites for SMBs since 2020. Transport, services, retail, professional services. Here’s the truth no one explains: yes, a brochure site in France can cost from €300 to €30,000. But no, it’s not a scam — you’re comparing different deliverables.</p>
<p>€800 buys you a technical install (empty). €2,500 buys a complete site with content and SEO. €8,000 buys an agency process (project manager, workshops, heavy coordination).</p>
<p>This article breaks down real market prices, why they differ, and how to avoid paying twice — once to “build” a site, and again to make it usable.</p>

<h2>2025 market: two worlds that barely talk</h2>
<p>No‑Code/AI tools exploded the low‑end offer (Wix ADI, Hostinger AI, Framer AI). Agencies sell €10k+ sites with UX strategy and SEO support.</p>
<p>Freelancers sit in the middle (€500–€5,000). Everyone uses “brochure site” to describe very different outcomes.</p>

<h2>SaaS builders: €15–€50/month (you don’t own much)</h2>
<p>Wix, Squarespace, Hostinger, Webflow. You get an editor, hosting, SSL, a template.</p>
<p><strong>But:</strong> you get a tool, not a finished site. Design is a template thousands use. You write the text. You manage SEO. Stop paying and your site disappears.</p>
<p><em>Real 3‑year cost</em>: €540–€1,800 in subscription + 20–60 hours of your time + content you must write.</p>

<h2>Freelancers: €300–€10,000 (the wide gap hides everything)</h2>
<h3>Low range: €300–€1,000 (empty shell)</h3>
<p>CMS install, premium theme, basic setup. No bespoke design, no copy, no SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Classic trap:</strong> pay €500 for WordPress + blank pages, then add €1,200 copy + €800 SEO → total €2,500 — same as a complete site upfront.</p>
<h3>Mid range: €1,000–€5,000 (great if the scope is clear)</h3>
<p>Bespoke brand, 5–10 pages, performance, responsive. <strong>Warning:</strong> some write content, others don’t; some do basic SEO, others deliver an invisible site.</p>
<h3>High range: €5,000–€10,000 (tailored build)</h3>
<p>Specific features (calculator, client area, APIs/CRM), UX for your business, initial SEO support.</p>

<h2>Agencies: €2,000–€30,000 (project management costs more than code)</h2>
<p>Full team (PM, UX/UI, dev, SEO). Structured process (workshops, mockups, approvals). You pay as much for coordination as for code.</p>
<p>Large projects (CRM/ERP, multilingual, client area, payment, 12‑month SEO, video): €10,000–€30,000+. For a simple 5–8 page brochure, a big agency is rarely relevant.</p>

<h2>What’s really included (details matter)</h2>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: €10–€20/yr; ensure it’s registered in your name.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting</strong>: static (Netlify/Vercel) <strong>free</strong>; WordPress shared = €2–€10/mo. A €80/mo VPS for 5 pages is overkill.</p>
<p><strong>SSL</strong>: Let’s Encrypt in 99% of cases.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong>: template €0–€80; customized €300–€1,000; full bespoke €1,500–€5,000.</p>
<p><strong>Content & initial SEO</strong>: basic copy €50–€150/page; optimized €150–€400/page; strategy €2,000–€5,000.</p>

<h2>Case study: bmsventouse.fr — 4 months after launch</h2>
<p><strong>Client</strong>: BMS Ventousage (film/event suction services). <strong>Offer</strong>: Professional (€2,490). <strong>Timeline</strong>: 5 weeks. <strong>Stack</strong>: static site (free Netlify).</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> (Search Console, 4 months): average positions 2–10 on target queries.</p>
<p><strong>Total cost (4 months)</strong>: €2,490 + €10 domain + €0 hosting + €0 maintenance. Two contracts signed — site paid for itself.</p>

<h2>7 questions before you sign</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Design: customized template or full bespoke? Mockups validated.</li>
  <li>Content: who writes it? Included or not?</li>
  <li>SEO basics: tags, headings, sitemap, optimized images?</li>
  <li>Ownership: domain & code in your name (GitHub provided)?</li>
  <li>Maintenance: WordPress = mandatory; static = €0.</li>
  <li>Recurring costs: domain, hosting, licenses — written summary.</li>
  <li>Process & timelines: plan with milestones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our pricing: static sites without mandatory maintenance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Essential (€1,490)</strong>: 3–5 pages, semi‑custom design, technical SEO, free Netlify, no maintenance.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional (€2,490)</strong>: bespoke design, <em>full copywriting</em> with SEO, guaranteed performance, no maintenance.</li>
  <li><strong>Premium (€4,990)</strong>: 10–15 pages or multilingual, 6‑month SEO strategy, advanced integrations (CRM, API), 6‑month premium support.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why our prices differ</em>: static ≠ WordPress. Static: no mandatory maintenance, maximum security, fast by default.</p>
<p>See <a href="/en/pricing-2025">Pricing 2025</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Verdict: don’t choose by initial price — choose by 3‑year cost</h2>
<p>A €300 site can cost €3,200 after content + SEO + maintenance. A €2,490 static site is objectively cheaper over 3 years.</p>
<p>Do the math. Demand a line‑by‑line quote. And remember: your site must <strong>generate clients</strong>, not just exist.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>How much for a brochure site in 2025?</h3>
<p>€1,500–€8,000 depending on provider and inclusions. I recommend €1,490 minimum for a professional site with personalized design and SEO. Cheap templates at €500 will cost more later in copy + SEO.</p>
<h3>Why do quotes vary from €1,500 to €7,000 for the same project?</h3>
<p>Because deliverables differ. €1,500 = technical only (CMS + template). €7,000 = bespoke design + professional copy + SEO + project management + maintenance. Demand a line‑by‑line quote.</p>
<h3>Is a €300 site reliable?</h3>
<p>No. €300 = WordPress install + generic theme + blank pages. Add €1,000 copy, €500 design, €800 SEO → €2,600 minimum… often with no results.</p>
<h3>Annual costs after creation?</h3>
<p>WordPress: €340–€2,100/year (domain + hosting + maintenance). Static: €10–€50/year (domain only), hosting free, maintenance €0.</p>
<h3>Do I own my site once paid?</h3>
<p>SaaS (Wix/Squarespace): you rent. Stop subscription and it’s gone. Freelancer/agency: normally yes, verify code + domain transfer. Our sites: full ownership (GitHub code, domain in your name).</p>
<h3>WordPress or static: which to choose?</h3>
<p>Static if you want €0 maintenance, speed and security. WordPress if very active blog/e‑commerce and you accept maintenance. For 95% of SMB brochure sites, static is more profitable over 3 years.</p>
