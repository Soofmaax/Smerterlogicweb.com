# Your role in building the site: what’s really expected from you

<p>Your site has been “in progress” for eight weeks. Your freelancer sent three emails asking for your copy. You still haven’t found time. The homepage mockup arrived two weeks ago. You haven’t reviewed it.</p>
<p>Today the freelancer calls you: the project is blocked. They can’t proceed without your copy. They can’t develop without your design approval. The original eight‑week timeline? We’re now at sixteen weeks. Double.</p>
<p>I’ve built sites for SMBs since 2020. Here’s the truth most won’t tell you: <strong>timelines depend as much on you as on the provider</strong>. 80% of delays come from the client — late content, slow approvals, unclear brief.</p>
<p>A brochure site <a href="/en/blog/website-launch-timeline">can be delivered in 7–12 weeks</a> if you’re prepared and responsive. Otherwise expect 16–24 weeks. This article details your <strong>3 pillars</strong> of responsibility (content, approvals, clarity), the <strong>checklist</strong> to prepare, and how to <strong>accelerate</strong> without losing quality.</p>

<h2>The myth of the provider who “does everything”</h2>
<p>Paying a provider doesn’t remove your role. The web is a <strong>co‑production</strong>: your provider brings tech, design and SEO; you bring business, audience, positioning and objectives.</p>

<h2>Pillar 1 — Content: bottleneck #1</h2>
<p>80% of late projects: <strong>content late/incomplete</strong>.</p>
<h3>Copy and SEO (structured, finalized, optimized)</h3>
<p>Provide a <strong>structured</strong> doc per page (H1/H2/H3, short paragraphs, CTAs). Ideal format: Google Docs/Word. Avoid PDFs or snippets by email.</p>
<p>Deliver <strong>all content at once</strong>. Dripping content page by page stalls the project for 4 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: block 2 days to write; otherwise outsource (€150–€400/page). €1,000–€2,000 invested = <strong>4 weeks saved</strong>.</p>
<h3>Visuals (quality and rights)</h3>
<p>Pro photos (team, offices, work), vector logo (SVG/AI/EPS), brand guide (colors, fonts). Without that: stock photos or a shoot to organize (€500–€1,500), or waiting → bigger delay.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: schedule a shoot beforehand. Provide HD photos (≥1500px); your provider will optimize to WebP. Formats: JPEG HQ (1–3MB), PNG for logos.</p>

<h2>Pillar 2 — Fast approvals: the fuel of the project</h2>
<p>Every blocked approval stops the project (sequential flow). 1 week of delay on a milestone = +2–3 weeks in dev/testing.</p>
<h3>3 critical moments</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brief & scope (week 1)</strong>: approve within <strong>48h</strong>. Late changes → reset scope/timeline/budget.</li>
  <li><strong>Home mockup & patterns (week 3–4)</strong>: review within 48h, consolidated feedback (color codes, sizes, zones).</li>
  <li><strong>Final approval (week 7–10)</strong>: multi‑device/browser testing; report <strong>everything</strong> at once; fixes → re‑tests within 48h.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing your mind after validation</h3>
<p>Change after approval → redo → doubled timeline and budget.</p>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: max 2 cycles for design; 1 cycle for QA. Beyond that → hourly billing (forces decisions).</p>

<h2>Pillar 3 — Strategic clarity</h2>
<p>Define <strong>objectives</strong> (leads, e‑commerce, reassurance), <strong>audience</strong>, <strong>differentiation</strong>, 3 key services, 3 sites you like/dislike (and why). Two‑page brief → <strong>−2 weeks</strong> on scoping.</p>

<h2>Accelerate without sacrificing quality</h2>
<h3>Levers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content by week 2</strong> — <strong>−3–4 weeks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Approve within 48h</strong> — <strong>−15 days cumulative</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Proven tech</strong> (CMS/Static rather than full custom) — <strong>−2–4 weeks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never sacrifice</strong>: scoping, QA (UX/perf), technical SEO.</p>

<h2>Case: 5‑week delivery</h2>
<p>BMS Ventousage: clear brief, photos ready, 1 design iteration, 3‑day tests → <strong>+21 days saved</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: brief before kick‑off, 2 days to write everything, 48h approvals, respect the scope.</p>
