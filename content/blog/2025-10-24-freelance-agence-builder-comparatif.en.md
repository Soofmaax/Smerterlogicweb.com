# Freelancer vs Agency vs No‑Code builder: what should you choose for a static site?

<p>You’ve decided to build a showcase website. Great — first step done. Now the real question: <strong>who will build it, and with which technology</strong>?</p>
<p>You see three options. A freelancer quotes €2,800. An agency quotes €7,500. Wix says you can do it yourself for €30/month. You don’t know which difference justifies the price gap. You wonder whether a <strong>static site</strong> is enough, or if you must invest in a <strong>dynamic CMS</strong> to evolve later.</p>
<p>I’ve built sites for SMBs since 2020: transport, services, retail, professional services. Here’s the truth few explain clearly: <strong>the provider and technology choice depends less on budget than on objectives and your ability to operate the site after delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article we compare the three options (freelancer, agency, builder) on concrete criteria: <em>initial budget</em>, <em>hidden costs</em>, <em>delivered quality</em>, <em>flexibility</em>. We also clarify when a <strong>static</strong> site is enough, and when you truly need a <strong>dynamic</strong> one. By the end, you’ll know exactly what fits your situation.</p>

<h2>The three models, face to face: budget, value, trade‑offs</h2>
<p>For SMBs, provider choice is about value and speed more than absolute budget. You should aim for a <strong>MVP</strong> fast to avoid analysis‑paralysis. Too many owners compare quotes for 6 months instead of launching a site that starts generating leads.</p>
<p>Here are the three options, stripped of fluff.</p>

<h2>Option 1 — Freelancer (best trade‑off for 95% of SMBs)</h2>
<p>One person (developer, designer or both) runs your project end‑to‑end. No middleman. You talk <strong>directly</strong> to the person who codes.</p>
<h3>Real budget</h3>
<p>Professional showcase site: <strong>€2,500–€8,000</strong> (5–10 pages). <strong>Maintenance</strong>: €50–€150/month if you want it — <em>for a static site, it’s not mandatory</em>.</p>
<h3>Concrete advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum flexibility</strong>: adjustable scope, stepwise evolutions, compressed timelines.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal guidance</strong>: no intermediaries, quick responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Reactive</strong>: small tweaks in minutes, controlled costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limits to know</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dependency</strong> on one person (vacation, overload): check reputation and realistic deadlines.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi‑discipline expertise</strong>: rarely top in <em>everything</em> (design/SEO/back‑end). For complex needs they outsource (cost ↑) or result is uneven.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a typical SMB showcase (services, projects, contact): a <strong>competent freelancer</strong> is enough. For e‑commerce + CRM + SLA: consider an agency.</p>

<h2>Option 2 — Web agency (complex projects or comfortable budgets)</h2>
<p>Agency = multi‑discipline team (PM, UX/UI, front, back, SEO, copywriting). One point of contact, several specialists involved.</p>
<h3>Real budget</h3>
<p><strong>€5,000–€25,000</strong> (5–20 pages). <strong>Maintenance</strong>: €150–€500/month (SLA, updates, structured support).</p>
<h3>Concrete advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Complete expertise</strong>: each topic handled by a specialist.</li>
  <li><strong>Structured support</strong>: hotline, guaranteed timelines, long‑term follow‑up.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuity</strong>: no dependency on one person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limits</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Higher cost</strong>: 50–60% of project management/coordination.</li>
  <li><strong>Relative rigidity</strong>: tickets, validations, quotes → delays and overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant if: complex project (multilingual, CRM, client area), budget > €10,000, strategic support needed.</p>

<h2>Option 3 — No‑Code builders (Wix, Webflow): fast and cheap, but limited</h2>
<p>Build a site without coding: template, drag‑and‑drop, publish. Target: entrepreneurs who want to operate alone.</p>
<h3>Real budget</h3>
<p><strong>DIY</strong>: €15–€50/month (€180–€1,800/3 years) + your time. <strong>Turn‑key</strong>: up to €4,000 if a pro builds in Webflow.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost & speed</strong>: live in hours/days.</li>
  <li><strong>No code</strong>: simple visual interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limits (major)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Customization/scalability</strong> limited; Webflow: learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform lock‑in</strong>: migration is hard/expensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk of poor optimization</strong>: heavy pages, misconfigured tags, average SEO.</li>
  <li><strong>Opportunity cost</strong>: 40h spent = lost revenue > initial savings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant for <em>testing</em> with near‑zero budget or very technical profiles. For a client‑oriented professional site: rarely sufficient.</p>

<h2>Static vs dynamic site: when is static enough?</h2>
<h3>What’s a static site?</h3>
<p>Server → <em>pre‑built</em> HTML/CSS/JS files. No database, no on‑the‑fly generation. Advantages: <strong>speed</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>simplified maintenance</strong>. Ideal for showcases (services, projects, contact).</p>
<p>Our sites (€1,490 / €2,490 / €4,990) are <strong>static</strong> → zero mandatory maintenance, free hosting, maximum speed. <a href="/en/blog/cout-site-vitrine-2025">Compare the costs</a>.</p>
<h3>What’s a dynamic site?</h3>
<p>CMS + database → page built <em>on demand</em>. Enables personalization, accounts, search, updates via an interface.</p>
<p>Essential for: <strong>e‑commerce</strong>, <strong>very active blog</strong>, <strong>client area</strong>, interactivity.</p>
<h3>How to choose?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Content changed <strong>every week</strong>? → Dynamic.</li>
  <li>Interactive features (accounts/payment)? → Dynamic.</li>
  <li>No time/budget for technical maintenance? → Static.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our recommendation for 95% of SMBs</h2>
<p><strong>Start simple</strong>: a static showcase that presents services, projects, and captures leads via a form. Hire a <strong>competent freelancer</strong> (€2,500–€8,000) or choose a <a href="/en/pricing-2025">turn‑key static offer</a>. Zero mandatory maintenance, free hosting, full ownership.</p>
<p>Avoid DIY builders if you lack time/skills: opportunity cost beats savings, and SEO risk is high.</p>
<p><strong>Move to dynamic only if needed</strong>: very active blog, e‑commerce, user accounts.</p>

<h2>Verdict: freelancer + static site is the sweet spot for SMBs</h2>
<p>For 95% of SMBs: <strong>freelancer + static</strong> = controlled budget, professional quality, zero maintenance, full ownership. Agencies: relevant for complex projects > €10,000. No‑Code builders: risky without expertise/time.</p>
<p>Need a fast static site with no mandatory maintenance? We build SMB‑optimized sites: bespoke design, included content, ultra‑fast, zero maintenance. Examples: bmsventouse.fr (Google positions 2–10 in 4 months). From €1,490. Source code provided, domain in your name.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Freelancer or agency: concrete difference for SMBs?</h3>
<p>Freelancer: €2,500–€8,000, flexibility and value. Agency: €5,000–€25,000+, complete team (designer, dev, SEO), structured support. For a standard showcase, a freelancer suffices. Agency if CRM/multilingual/client area or budget > €10,000.</p>
<h3>Is a static site really enough for my activity?</h3>
<p>Yes if content is stable and no complex interactivity. Static = maximum speed, strong security, zero maintenance. Dynamic if very active blog, e‑commerce, user accounts.</p>
<h3>Are No‑Code builders (Wix, Webflow) a good option?</h3>
<p>Only if you have time and skills, or in a test phase with near‑zero budget. The time spent (40h+) often costs more than a €2,500 freelancer, and SEO is rarely optimal.</p>
<h3>Real 3‑year cost (freelancer vs agency vs builder)?</h3>
<p>DIY builder: €180–€1,800 subscription/3 years + 40h of your time. Static freelancer: €2,500–€8,000 build + €10–€50/year (domain). WordPress agency: €5,000–€25,000 build + €1,800–€6,000/year maintenance. Freelancer + static is most cost‑effective for SMBs.</p>
<h3>Can I move from static to dynamic later?</h3>
<p>Yes, via partial/full redesign: content migration to a CMS (WordPress, Webflow CMS), structure recreation, testing. Cost: €1,500–€5,000 depending on complexity.</p>
<h3>How to verify a freelancer’s competence?</h3>
<p>Portfolio (links), speed (PageSpeed), SEO (brand search), client references, clarity (code ownership, SEO included, timelines). Beware of unrealistic promises.</p>
