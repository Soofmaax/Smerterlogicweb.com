# Hidden costs: what to expect after your website is delivered

<p>You paid €1,500 for your showcase site. Your freelancer delivered a clean, fast, functional website. You’re happy.</p>
<p>Three months later: first “surprise” invoice — €150 maintenance. Then €80 for a plugin license. Then €200 to fix a plugin conflict after an update.</p>
<p>After one year, you’ve spent €2,100 — 40% more than the build price.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to hidden costs.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve built sites for SMBs since 2020. Here’s what no one explains at signature time: the creation price is only part of the story. The <strong>Total Cost of Ownership</strong> over three years (TCO) is the only number that matters. And the differences are massive.</p>
<p>A €1,500 WordPress site will cost €3,300–€5,100 over three years. A €2,490 static site will cost… €2,490 (no technical maintenance). In this article, we detail recurring costs, compare real totals, and clarify payment terms so you won’t be surprised again.</p>

<h2>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): the number no one shows you</h2>
<p>TCO = creation + hosting + domain + maintenance + licenses + evolutions — for a set period.</p>
<p>The gaps widen on recurring costs. A site built for €800 can cost €600/year in maintenance: <strong>€2,600/3 years</strong>. A site built for €2,490 with <strong>no maintenance</strong> costs <strong>€2,490/3 years</strong>. <em>Request TCO in writing</em> before you sign.</p>

<h2>Mandatory recurring costs: what you pay each year</h2>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: €10–€20/year. Renew annually; set an email reminder and auto‑renew.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting</strong>: static = Netlify/Vercel <strong>free</strong>. WordPress shared = €50–€120/year. VPS = €600–€4,800/year (rarely needed for a brochure site).</p>
<p><strong>Plugin licenses (WordPress)</strong>: €50–€1,200/year depending on features (forms, security, backups, SEO, e‑commerce). Watch out for trials turning paid later.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum yearly baseline</strong>: €110–€640 (domain + hosting + licenses). If you pay nothing on WordPress, you’re either not the owner or your site is outdated (risk).</p>

<h2>Technical maintenance: the WordPress money sink</h2>
<p>WordPress = database, thousands of plugins, frequent updates. Without maintenance, your site becomes a <strong>security hole</strong>. 43% of compromises come from outdated plugins/themes. Cleaning: €500–€2,000.</p>
<p>Maintenance includes core/plugins/theme updates, backups, monitoring, fixes, and support. 2025 prices: <strong>€290–€1,800/year</strong> (freelancer → agency). Average observed: €396–€1,980/year.</p>
<p><strong>Static sites</strong> (pure HTML/CSS/JS) have <strong>no CMS/DB/plugins</strong> → <strong>€0 maintenance</strong>, minimal attack surface, free hosting, domain €10–€20/year.</p>
<p><strong>Over 3 years</strong>: WordPress basic €870 (€290/year); WordPress intermediate €5,400 (€1,800/year); Static = €0 (excluding domain). This is why a €2,490 static site is often <em>cheaper</em> over 3 years than a €1,500 WordPress site.</p>

<h2>Strategic costs: ongoing SEO & content</h2>
<p>SEO is a marathon. Competitors publish and optimize; if you do nothing, you lose visibility.</p>
<p><strong>SEO support</strong>: €300–€1,500/month depending on goals (audit, optimization, new pages, competitor tracking). <strong>SEO copy</strong>: €150–€400/article (1,000–1,500 words).</p>

<h2>Evolution plan: €20/month to keep improving without calling a developer</h2>
<p>Typical problem: every small change costs €80/h. Result: you change nothing and your site ages.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution plan</strong>: €20/month, no commitment, 1h/month (rollover 3 months). Add/modify text, images, sections, small pages, minor design adjustments, one‑off SEO, minor fixes.</p>
<p>Priority support within 24 business hours, monitoring (uptime, speed), alerts.</p>
<p>Preferential rates: redesign −30%, features −25%, SEO article €99, advanced page −20%.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: 12 months of small evolutions = €240 for 12 hours (equivalent €20/h) vs €960 at €80/h.</p>
<p>Optional: a static site can run for years without changes. Ideal if you want a living site on a controlled budget.</p>

<h2>Payment terms: deposit, staged, subscription</h2>
<p><strong>Deposit</strong>: 50% at signature to secure commitment and start (standard).</p>
<p><strong>Staged</strong>: 50% (signature) + 30% (mockups validated) + 20% (delivery). Professional plan €2,490: €1,245 + €747 + €498.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly subscription</strong>: €120–€500/month (hosting, maintenance, small evolutions). Pro: zero hassle. Major con: <strong>ownership</strong> — you often do not own the site; stop the subscription and it disappears. Over 3 years: €3,600–€18,000 with no ownership.</p>

<h2>Total 3‑year cost: 4 scenarios</h2>
<h3>1) WordPress (freelance low‑end)</h3>
<p>Creation €800; shared hosting €60/yr; domain €15/yr; maintenance €290/yr; licenses €100/yr.</p>
<p><strong>Total 3 years</strong>: €2,195 (excluding content). With copy (€1,000) + SEO (€800) → <strong>€3,995</strong>.</p>
<h3>2) WordPress (agency)</h3>
<p>Creation €3,500; VPS €700/yr; domain €15/yr; maintenance €1,800/yr; licenses €300/yr.</p>
<p><strong>Total 3 years</strong>: <strong>€11,945</strong>.</p>
<h3>3) Static Essential (€1,490)</h3>
<p>Hosting €0; domain €10/yr; maintenance €0.</p>
<p><strong>Total 3 years</strong>: <strong>€1,520</strong>.</p>
<h3>4) Static Professional (€2,490)</h3>
<p>Hosting €0; domain €10/yr; maintenance €0; <em>optional</em> Evolution plan €240/yr.</p>
<p><strong>Total 3 years</strong>: <strong>€2,520</strong> (without Evolution) or <strong>€3,240</strong> (with Evolution).</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to avoid: sneaky subscriptions and hidden clauses</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pre‑checked boxes (VIP services, “premium backups”). Read every line.</li>
  <li>Auto‑renewal with unannounced price increase. Disable it and set reminders.</li>
  <li>Plugins turning paid. Ask for the list of plugins, their annual cost, and alternatives.</li>
  <li>Maintenance with 12‑month minimum term. Refuse; prefer 1‑month notice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verdict: the real cost is the 3‑year TCO</h2>
<p>A €800 site with €2,195 recurring costs over 3 years can be <em>more expensive</em> than a €2,490 site without mandatory maintenance. Before you sign: demand TCO, plus a summary of annual costs (domain, hosting, maintenance, licenses, SEO).</p>
<p>Verify <strong>ownership</strong> (domain + code). Refuse long commitments. Calculate TCO before choosing. The cheapest at purchase is rarely the cheapest over 3 years.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>WordPress: €340–€2,100/yr (domain €50–€300, hosting €50–€300, maintenance €290–€1,800). Static: €10–€50/yr (domain), free hosting, €0 maintenance.</p>
<h3>Is WordPress maintenance really mandatory?</h3>

<h3>Why does a static site need no maintenance?</h3>
<p>No database, no CMS → smaller attack surface; frozen code + static hosting → robustness and simplicity.</p>
<h3>What is the Evolution plan at €20/month?</h3>
<p>1h/month (rollover 3 months); content/design tweaks, small SEO, monitoring, priority support, preferential rates.</p>
<h3>Do I need to pay a deposit?</h3>
<p>Yes: standard 50% at signature, then 30% at mockup validation, 20% at delivery. This secures both sides.</p>
<h3>Subscription or upfront purchase?</h3>
<p>Purchase if you want to <strong>own</strong> and control your digital assets (static recommended). Subscription if you accept renting — be careful: stop paying and the site disappears.</p>
