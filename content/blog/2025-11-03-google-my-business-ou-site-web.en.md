# Website or Google My Business: which to prioritize?

<p>You want to build your online presence. With a limited budget, what comes first: a <strong>Google Business Profile</strong> or a <strong>website</strong>?</p>
<p>Your competitor has a beautiful €5,000 site but appears nowhere in Google. Your neighbor only has a Google Business Profile (GBP) and gets three calls a day. What’s the right move?</p>
<p>Since 2020 I’ve built sites for local businesses: plumbers, carpenters, lawyers, home services, restaurants. The honest answer: it depends on your audience and immediate goal. <strong>But for 90% of local SMBs, GBP comes first.</strong></p>

<h2>Local SEO vs global SEO</h2>
<h3>Global SEO (website): broad visibility, slower results</h3>
<p>Targets national queries; requires <strong>content</strong> + <strong>links</strong>; users are in information/comparison mode. <strong>Timeline</strong>: 6–12 months for tangible impact — great for <em>growth</em>, not for <em>immediate leads</em>.</p>
<h3>Local SEO (GBP): immediate visibility, “hot” users</h3>
<p>Targets “service + city” and transactional intent. Appears in the <strong>Local Pack</strong> and Google Maps. <strong>Results</strong>: calls/directions within days.</p>

<h2>Key numbers</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>+70%</strong> visits with <em>complete</em> GBP (info, photos, reviews, posts).</li>
  <li><strong>50%</strong> of local mobile searches lead to a <strong>same‑day visit</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher conversion rate</strong> than general queries (clear, urgent intent).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost‑benefit: when GBP first, when website first</h2>
<h3>Case 1 — GBP first (Minimum Viable Presence)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Local clientele (artisan, shop, home services, professional services)</li>
  <li>Initial budget <strong>&lt; €1,500</strong></li>
  <li>Need to <strong>validate demand</strong> before investing in a site</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: free, immediate, built‑in reviews, simple updates. <strong>Limits</strong>: fixed format, limited UX control, occasional slow corrections.</p>
<h3>Case 2 — Website second (control, authority, growth)</h3>
<p>Website brings <strong>UX/design control</strong>, <strong>authority</strong> (content + links), and <strong>conversion funnels</strong> (newsletter, detailed quotes, bookings). Essential to consolidate/amplify GBP flow and target beyond local.</p>
<h3>Case 3 — Website first (exceptions)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No local audience (100% online freelancer, e‑learning, national e‑commerce)</li>
  <li><strong>Content‑first</strong> strategy (blog, guides, webinars)</li>
  <li><strong>Complex services</strong> needing deep reassurance</li>
</ul>
<p>Even then: if you have an address/area, create a GBP (1h, free).</p>

<h2>Winning sequence: GBP then website</h2>
<h3>Step 1 — Create & optimize your GBP (week 1)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fill 100% info (NAP, hours, categories, keyword‑rich description)</li>
  <li>Add ≥ 10 photos (logo, cover, work, team)</li>
  <li>Request <strong>reviews</strong> regularly and reply to all</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 — Validate local demand (months 1–3)</h3>
<p>Track impressions, clicks, <strong>calls</strong>, directions. If zero calls → incomplete profile/wrong categories/low reviews/wrong area — adjust before spending on a site.</p>
<h3>Step 3 — Invest in a website (after validation)</h3>
<p><strong>Recommended SMB budget</strong>: €1,500–€3,000 for a <strong>static showcase site</strong> (no mandatory maintenance, free hosting, fast). Link GBP ↔ site.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: Marie (carpenter, Toulouse) → optimized GBP (3–4 quotes/week) → showcase site (6 pages, quote CTA) → <strong>+300%</strong> quotes, <strong>#1</strong> “menuisier Toulouse”, <strong>+180%</strong> revenue in 8 months.</p>

<h2>Strategy matrix</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Criteria</th><th>Google Business Profile</th><th>Showcase site</th><th>SMB takeaway</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><strong>Main goal</strong></td><td>Local visibility, immediate conversion (call, directions)</td><td>Authority, branding, conversion funnels</td><td>GBP = immediate cash‑flow</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Initial cost</strong></td><td>Free / low effort</td><td>€1,000–€15,000+</td><td>Website = second investment</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Conversion rate</strong></td><td>Very high (local intent)</td><td>Complex leads (quotes, signup)</td><td>Site handles “why”, GBP handles “where”</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Control & scalability</strong></td><td>Limited (Google format)</td><td>Total (UX/design/content)</td><td>Site needed for unique value</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Time to results</strong></td><td>Immediate (48h–2 weeks)</td><td>Mid/long‑term (3–12 months)</td><td>GBP validates, site amplifies</td></tr>

<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Investing €5,000 in a site <em>before</em> GBP</li>
  <li>Leaving GBP <strong>incomplete</strong> (−70% visits)</li>
  <li>Never creating a site after GBP → limited local growth</li>
  <li>Not linking GBP ↔ site (URL, reviews, Maps) → lost synergy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verdict: GBP first, website second, always in synergy</h2>
<p>For 90% of local SMBs: <strong>GBP</strong> is the priority (free, fast, immediate ROI). The <strong>site</strong> consolidates and amplifies (authority, conversion, branding). Sequence: week 1 → GBP; months 1–3 → validate; then → professional site €1,500–€3,000 (<a href="/en/pricing-2025">static recommended</a>).</p>
<p>Remember: 50% of local mobile searches lead to a visit the same day. Without GBP, you lose half of potential clients.</p>
<p>Need a site after GBP? Static sites that <strong>amplify</strong> local visibility: bespoke design, local SEO content, GBP integration, conversion forms, €0 maintenance. From €1,490.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>GBP or website first?</h3>
<p>For 90% of local SMBs: <strong>GBP first</strong>. Complete profile → +70% visits; 50% of local mobile searches → same‑day visit. Invest in the site after 3 months of validation through GBP.</p>
<h3>Can you completely rely on GBP without a website?</h3>
<p>No for long‑term growth: GBP captures hot leads; the site reassures, educates (content), manages funnels and enables expansion.</p>
<h3>How to optimize GBP for the Local Pack?</h3>
<p>Complete info, 10+ photos, regular reviews (and replies), GBP posts, consistent NAP everywhere (site/directories/social).</p>
<h3>How long to see results with GBP?</h3>
<p>Visibility: 48h–2 weeks (after validation). Calls: 1–4 weeks if profile is complete. Top‑3 local: 2–3 months with reviews and updated info.</p>
<h3>What budget to plan for a site after GBP?</h3>
<p><strong>€1,500–€3,000</strong> for a professional showcase (5–8 pages, local SEO, GBP integration, forms, fast hosting, full ownership). <a href="/en/pricing-2025">Static site recommended</a>.</p>
<h3>My competitor has a big site but is invisible — how?</h3>
<p>They probably neglected GBP and local SEO. Without an optimized GBP, they’re invisible in the <strong>Local Pack</strong>. Create a complete profile now — you can outrank them within a week for local intent.</p>
